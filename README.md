Welcome to Fellaware!

Before you use any of my code, you must understand this or you will be banned from using my code:

1) I am not responsible for any loses endured whilst the contents of this GitHub repository are in use. YOU are responsible for your own actions, including deciding to cheat in video games, which is something that may cause you to get banned and lose in-gane progress and items.
2) Nothing is 100% undetected. You may get banned while the cheat is being used, although in my testing, when the cheat was being maintained and frequently used, it had been detected 0 times over ~150 hours of play active play-time.
3) At the end of the day, it is your choice to cheat or not. I do not care if you get banned, that is a you problem. Should've considered it before you decided to cheat and get banned.
